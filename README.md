# Pattie Reaves

My Github page 🌈 Built with Next.js and Github pages.

## Steps to publish:

1. `npm run dev` and write happy codes.
1. Making commits to the master branch will save your changes, but ...
1. When ready to deploy, `npm run deploy` will auto do the next export into the out directory, which then the gh-pages module will auto-deploy to that branch of this repository and serve on github pages (as set up in the repositoroy settings to serve through.)
